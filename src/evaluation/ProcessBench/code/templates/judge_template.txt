I will show you a [Math Problem], a [Reference Solution], and an [AI's Solution] generated by an AI assistant. Your task is to determine if the **final answer** in the [AI's Solution] matches the answer in the [Reference Solution].

--------------------------------------------------

[Math Problem]

{problem}

[Reference Solution]

{solution}

[AI's Solution]

{response}

--------------------------------------------------

Please evaluate whether the **final answer** in the [AI's Solution] is correct, based solely on whether it matches the **final answer** in the [Reference Solution].

Note that the [AI's Solution] does not need to replicate same reasoning steps of the [Reference Solution]; it only needs to reach the same **final answer** to be considered correct.

Reply with only "Yes" or "No".
