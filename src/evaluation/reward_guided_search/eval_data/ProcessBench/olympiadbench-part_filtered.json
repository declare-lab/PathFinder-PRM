        "question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\nSuppose that $n$ is a house with $d(n)=1 / 27$. Determine the ten smallest positive integers $m$ (in the standard ordering of the integers) such that $m \\in \\mathcal{N}(n)$.",

We need to find the least possible sum of a list of positive integers that has these values as its mean (\\(\\mu\\)), median (\\(\\eta\\)), and unique mode (\\(\\omega\\)).\nStep 2: First, understanding the roles of Mean, Median, and Mode:\n- The mean (\\(\\mu\\)) is the average value.\n- The median (\\(\\eta\\)) is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order.\n- The mode (\\(\\omega\\)) is the most frequent value.\nStep 3: Second, considering the restrictions on Mean, Median, and Mode:\n- The mean cannot be less than the smallest number or greater than the largest number.\n- The median must be an actual value in the set if the set contains an odd number of elements.\n- The mode can be any value, but since we're looking for a unique mode, it must occur more times than any other number.",
        "now_step": "Step 4: Third, determining which of \\(x-1\\), \\(x\\), \\(x+1\\) should be the mode:\n- Since the mode needs to occur more times than any other number, it makes sense for the mode to be either \\(x\\) or \\(x+1\\), because they are higher numbers. However, choosing \\(x+1\\) as the mode would require more numbers to be larger than \\(x+1\\) to make it the mode, which would increase the mean unnecessarily.\n- Therefore, we choose \\(x\\) as the mode, as it allows us to have a lower mean while still fulfilling the condition that the mode occurs most frequently.",

Second, the coefficients \\(a, b, c\\) are integers. Third, the roots of the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are integers. Let's reason through this problem step by step. Since the graph passes through \\((0, 0)\\), substituting these values into \\(f(x)\\) gives:\n\\[ f(0) = a \\cdot 0^2 + b \\cdot 0 + c = 0 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ c = 0 \\]\nStep 2: Similarly, since the graph passes through \\((15, 225)\\), substituting these values into \\(f(x)\\) gives:\n\\[ f(15) = a \\cdot 15^2 + b \\cdot 15 + 0 = 225 \\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ 225a + 15b = 225 \\]\nDividing by 15 gives:\n\\[ 15a + b = 15 \\]\n\\[ b = 15 - 15a \\]\nStep 3: Now we have:\n\\[ f(x) = ax^2 + (15-15a)x + 0 = ax^2 + (15-15a)x \\]\nStep 4: For the roots of \\(f(x)\\) to be integers, the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant is given by:\n\\[ D = b^2 - 4ac = (15-15a)^2 - 4 \\cdot a \\cdot 0 = (15-15a)^2 \\]\nSince \\(c=0\\), the discriminant simplifies to a perfect square by definition.

        "previous_steps": "Step 1: To find the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), we will first need to understand how translating a parabola affects its equation, and then use the given information about the new parabola's \\( x \\)-intercepts.\nStep 2: The original parabola has the equation:\n\\[ y = x^2 - 2x + 4 \\]\nStep 3: When a parabola is translated \\( p \\) units to the right and \\( q \\) units down, the equation of the new parabola can be found by replacing \\( x \\) with \\( (x-p) \\) in the original equation and then subtracting \\( q \\) from the result. This gives us:\n\\[ y = (x-p)^2 - 2(x-p) + 4 - q \\]\nStep 4: Expanding this, we get:\n\\[ y = x^2 - 2px + p^2 - 2x + 2p + 4 - q \\]\n\\[ y = x^2 - (2p + 2)x + (p^2 + 2p + 4 - q) \\]\nStep 5: Given that the \\( x \\)-intercepts of the new parabola are 3 and 5, these are the solutions to the equation when \\( y=0 \\). Thus, for \\( x=3 \\) and \\( x=5 \\), the equation becomes:\n\\[ 0 = x^2 - (2p + 2)x + (p^2 + 2p + 4 - q) \\]\nStep 6: This means that \\( x=3 \\) and \\( x=5 \\) are roots of the quadratic equation. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots equals the coefficient of \\( x \\) divided by the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) (with opposite sign), and the product of the roots equals the constant term divided by the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\). Therefore:\nStep 7: First, the sum of the roots:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 2p + 2 \\]\n\\[ 8 = 2p + 2 \\]\n\\[ 6 = 2p \\]\n\\[ p = 3 \\]\nStep 8: Second, the product of the roots:\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 5 = p^2 + 2p + 4 - q \\]\n\\[ 15 = 3^2 + 2(3) + 4 - q \\]\n\\[ 15 = 9 + 6 + 4 - q \\]\n\\[ 15 = 19 - q \\]\n\\[ q = 4 \\]",
        "now_step": "Step 9: Therefore, the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are \\( \\boxed{3} \\) and \\( \\boxed{4} \\), respectively.",

If the entering class had two more students, there would be $T$ more ways of selecting the two slide rule oilers. Compute $n$.",
        "previous_steps": "Step 1: To solve this problem, we can use combinatorics. Let's denote the number of ways to select 2 students from the original class as \\( C(n, 2) \\), and the number of ways to select 2 students from the class with 2 additional students as \\( C(n+2, 2) \\). We know that \\( C(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) and \\( C(n+2, 2) = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2} \\).\nStep 2: The problem states that if the entering class had two more students, there would be \\( T \\) more ways of selecting the two slide rule oilers. This means:\n\\[ C(n+2, 2) - C(n, 2) = T \\]\nStep 3: Substituting the expressions for \\( C(n, 2) \\) and \\( C(n+2, 2) \\), we get:\n\\[ \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2} - \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = T \\]\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{n^2 + 3n + 2 - n^2 + n}{2} = T \\]\nStep 5: Combine like terms:\n\\[ \\frac{4n + 2}{2} = T \\]\nStep 6: Since \\( T = 75 \\), we have:\n\\[ \\frac{4n + 2}{2} = 75 \\]\nStep 7: Multiply both sides by 2:\n\\[ 4n + 2 = 150 \\]\nStep 8: Subtract 2 from both sides:\n\\[ 4n = 148 \\]\nStep 9: Divide both sides by 4:\n\\[ n = 37 \\]",

The line graph \\(L(K_8)\\) of \\(K_8\\) is a graph where each vertex represents an edge of \\(K_8\\), and two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding edges in \\(K_8\\) share a common vertex.",

Given that the angles of $\\triangle A B C$ are congruent to the angles of $\\triangle A P Q$ in some order of correspondence, compute $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B$ in degrees.",
        "previous_steps": "Step 1: Given that \\( \\angle BAP \\cong \\angle PAQ \\cong \\angle QAR \\cong \\angle RAS \\cong \\angle SAC \\), we can denote each of these angles as \\( \\theta \\). Therefore, we have: \\[ 5\\theta = \\angle BAC. \\] Since \\( \\angle BAC \\) is an angle in triangle \\( ABC \\), it must be less than \\( 180^\\circ \\). Hence, \\[ \\theta = \\frac{\\angle BAC}{5}. \\]\nStep 2: We are also given that the angles of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) are congruent to the angles of \\( \\triangle APQ \\) in some order. The angles of \\( \\triangle APQ \\) are \\( \\angle PAQ \\), \\( \\angle APQ \\), and \\( \\angle AQP \\). We know that \\( \\angle PAQ = \\theta \\). Let's denote the angles of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) as \\( \\angle BAC = 5\\theta \\), \\( \\angle ABC = B \\), and \\( \\angle ACB = C \\). Since the angles of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) are congruent to the angles of \\( \\triangle APQ \\), one of the angles \\( B \\) or \\( C \\) must be equal to \\( \\theta \\). Without loss of generality, let's assume \\( B = \\theta \\).\nStep 3: Then the remaining angle \\( C \\) must be equal to \\( \\angle APQ \\) or \\( \\angle AQP \\). The sum of the angles in a triangle is \\( 180^\\circ \\), so in \\( \\triangle ABC \\) we have: \\[ 5\\theta + \\theta + C = 180^\\circ. \\] This simplifies to: \\[ 6\\theta + C = 180^\\circ. \\] Therefore, \\[ C = 180^\\circ - 6\\theta. \\]\nStep 4: Now, we need to check if \\( C \\) can be equal to \\( \\angle APQ \\) or \\( \\angle AQP \\). In \\( \\triangle APQ \\), we have: \\[ \\angle APQ + \\angle AQP + \\theta = 180^\\circ. \\] This simplifies to: \\[ \\angle APQ + \\angle AQP = 180^\\circ - \\theta. \\] Since \\( C = 180^\\circ - 6\\theta \\), for \\( C \\) to be one of the angles \\( \\angle APQ \\) or \\( \\angle AQP \\), we must have: \\[ 180^\\circ - 6\\theta = \\angle APQ \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 180^\\circ - 6\\theta = \\angle AQP. \\]\nStep 5: However, \\( 180^\\circ - 6\\theta \\) must also satisfy: \\[ \\angle APQ + \\angle AQP = 180^\\circ - \\theta. \\] Substituting \\( \\angle AQP = 180^\\circ - 6\\theta \\) into the equation, we get: \\[ \\angle APQ + (180^\\circ - 6\\theta) = 180^\\circ - \\theta. \\] This simplifies to: \\[ \\angle APQ = 5\\theta. \\] Similarly, substituting \\( \\angle APQ = 180^\\circ - 6\\theta \\) into the equation, we get: \\[ (180^\\circ - 6\\theta) + \\angle AQP = 180^\\circ - \\theta. \\] This simplifies to: \\[ \\angle AQP = 5\\theta. \\]",
        "now_step": "Step 6: Thus, the angles of \\( \\triangle APQ \\) are \\( \\theta \\), \\( 5\\theta \\), and \\( 180^\\circ - 6\\theta \\), which are the same as the angles of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) in some order. Therefore, the assumption \\( B = \\theta \\) is consistent. Since \\( B = \\theta \\) and \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\angle BAC}{5} \\), we have: \\[ B = \\frac{\\angle BAC}{5}. \\] Given that \\( \\angle BAC = 5\\theta \\), we substitute \\( \\theta = \\frac{180^\\circ - 6\\theta}{5} \\) into the equation: \\[ B = \\frac{180^\\circ - 6\\theta}{5} = \\frac{180^\\circ}{7}. \\] Thus, the measure of \\( \\angle B \\) is: \\[ \\boxed{36}. \\]",

First, let's rewrite the equation in a more convenient form:\n\\[ 1 + 2^x + 2^{2x+1} = y^2 \\]\nStep 2: Notice that \\(2^{2x+1}\\) can be rewritten as:\n\\[ 2^{2x+1} = 2 \\cdot 2^{2x} = 2 \\cdot (2^x)^2 \\]\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\\[ 1 + 2^x + 2 \\cdot (2^x)^2 = y^2 \\]\nStep 3: Let \\(z = 2^x\\). Then the equation transforms into:\n\\[ 1 + z + 2z^2 = y^2 \\]\nStep 4: We now have a quadratic equation in terms of \\(z\\):\n\\[ 2z^2 + z + 1 = y^2 \\]\nStep 5: We need to find integer values of \\(z\\) such that \\(2z^2 + z + 1\\) is a perfect square. Let\u2019s denote this perfect square by \\(k^2\\), so:\n\\[ 2z^2 + z + 1 = k^2 \\]\nStep 6: Rearrange this equation to form a standard quadratic equation:\n\\[ 2z^2 + z + 1 - k^2 = 0 \\]\nStep 7: The discriminant of the quadratic equation \\(2z^2 + z + (1 - k^2) = 0\\) must be a perfect square for \\(z\\) to be an integer. The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by:\n\\[ \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (1 - k^2) = 1 - 8 + 8k^2 = 8k^2 - 7 \\]\nStep 8: For \\(z\\) to be an integer, \\(8k^2 - 7\\) must be a perfect square. Let \\(m^2 = 8k^2 - 7\\), where \\(m\\) is an integer. Then:\n\\[ m^2 - 8k^2 = -7 \\]\nStep 9: This is a Diophantine equation of the form \\(m^2 - 8k^2 = -7\\).\nStep 10: We need to find integer pairs \\((m, k)\\) that satisfy \\(m^2 - 8k^2 = -7\\). We can test small values of \\(k\\) to find solutions:\nStep 11: First, for \\(k = 1\\):\n\\[ m^2 - 8(1)^2 = -7 \\implies m^2 - 8 = -7 \\implies m^2 = 1 \\implies m = \\pm 1 \\]\nSo, \\((m, k) = (1, 1)\\) and \\((m, k) = (-1, 1)\\).\nStep 12: Second, for \\(k = -1\\):\n\\[ m^2 - 8(-1)^2 = -7 \\implies m^2 - 8 = -7 \\implies m^2 = 1 \\implies m = \\pm 1 \\]\nSo, \\((m, k) = (1, -1)\\) and \\((m, k) = (-1, -1)\\).\nStep 13: For each pair \\((m, k)\\), solve for \\(z\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2a} = \\frac{-1 \\pm m}{4} \\]",

Place the square base \\( E O J S \\) in the \\( xy \\)-plane with center at the origin \\((0, 0, 0)\\).

Therefore, we have:\n\\[ 1 - 2 \\log_{10}(3) = 2 \\log_{100}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\]\nStep 8: Since \\( \\log_{100}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right) = \\frac{\\log_{10}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)}{\\log_{10}(100)} = \\frac{\\log_{10}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)}{2} \\), we can substitute this into the equation:\n\\[ 1 - 2 \\log_{10}(3) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\log_{10}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)}{2} = \\log_{10}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\]\nStep 9: This simplifies to:\n\\[ 1 - 2 \\log_{10}(3) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{n+1}{n}\\right) \\]\nStep 10: Rewriting the left side using properties of logarithms, we get:\n\\[ \\log_{10}(10) - \\log_{10}(3^2) = \\log_{10}(10) - \\log_{10}(9) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right) \\]\nStep 11: Thus, we have:\n\\[ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{n+1}{n}\\right) \\]\nStep 12: Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments:\n\\[ \\frac{10}{9} = \\frac{n+1}{n} \\]\nStep 13: Solving for \\( n \\), we get:\n\\[ 10n = 9(n+1) \\implies 10n = 9n + 9 \\implies n = 9 \\]",

Since 7 is a prime number, the only way to express it as a sum of squares of integers is \\( 1^2 + 2^2 \\) (since 7 cannot be expressed as a single square). However, we are looking for polynomials with rational coefficients. In this case, we can express 7 as a sum of squares of two rational numbers: \\( (\\sqrt{7})^2 = (\\sqrt{7})^2 + 0^2 \\), but this does not satisfy our requirement of having rational coefficients for the polynomials. We need at least two non-zero terms.",
        "now_step": "Step 3: After trying different combinations, we find that 7 can be expressed as a sum of squares of three rational numbers: \\( (2)^2 + (1)^2 + (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\neq 7 \\), however, \\( (2)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 7 \\). However, we used integer coefficients here. Now we try with a simple expression like \\( x^2 \\) and constants. We see: \\( x^2 + 7 = (x^2 + 2)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 \\). Comparing both sides, we see we have satisfied our initial condition. So \\( n = 4 \\) satisfies the equation.",

        "previous_steps": "Step 1: To find the probability \\( p \\) that the number of heads showing on Hannah's coins is greater than the number of heads showing on Otto's coins, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the favorable outcomes. Hannah flips two coins, so she can get 0, 1, or 2 heads. The probability of each outcome is: - 0 heads: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) (TT)\n- 1 head: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (HT or TH)\n- 2 heads: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) (HH)\nStep 2: Otto flips \\( T = 5 \\) coins, so he can get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 heads. We will calculate the probability of each outcome:\nStep 3: - 0 heads: \\(\\frac{1}{2^5} = \\frac{1}{32}\\)\n- 1 head: \\(\\frac{5}{2^5} = \\frac{5}{32}\\)\n- 2 heads: \\(\\frac{10}{2^5} = \\frac{10}{32} = \\frac{5}{16}\\)\n- 3 heads: \\(\\frac{10}{2^5} = \\frac{10}{32} = \\frac{5}{16}\\)\n- 4 heads: \\(\\frac{5}{2^5} = \\frac{5}{32}\\)\n- 5 heads: \\(\\frac{1}{2^5} = \\frac{1}{32}\\)\nStep 4: Now, let's count the favorable outcomes, i.e., when Hannah gets more heads than Otto. If Hannah gets 2 heads, she will always get more heads than Otto if he gets 0 or 1 head. The probability of this event is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{5}{32} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{6}{32} = \\frac{6}{128}\n\\]\nStep 5: If Hannah gets 1 head, she will get more heads than Otto if he gets 0 heads. The probability of this event is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\nStep 6: Adding up these probabilities, we get:\n\\[\np = \\frac{6}{128} + \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{6}{128} + \\frac{2}{128} = \\frac{8}{128} = \\frac{1}{16}\n\\]",

Then we have: \\[ t = \\frac{3 + n}{4} \\] and \\[ n \\leq t^2 < n+1 \\]\nStep 3: Substituting \\(t = \\frac{3 + n}{4}\\) into the inequality, we get: \\[ n \\leq \\left( \\frac{3 + n}{4} \\right)^2 < n+1 \\] Expanding and simplifying the inequality, we have: \\[ n \\leq \\frac{(3 + n)^2}{16} < n+1 \\] Multiplying through by 16, we get: \\[ 16n \\leq (3 + n)^2 < 16(n+1) \\] Expanding \\((3 + n)^2\\), we have: \\[ 16n \\leq 9 + 6n + n^2 < 16n + 16 \\]\nStep 4: Rearranging the terms, we get two inequalities: First, \\(16n \\leq 9 + 6n + n^2\\) and Second, \\(9 + 6n + n^2 < 16n + 16\\).\nStep 5: Let's solve the first inequality: \\[ 16n \\leq 9 + 6n + n^2 \\implies n^2 - 10n + 9 \\geq 0 \\implies (n-1)(n-9) \\geq 0 \\] The solutions to this inequality are \\(n \\leq 1\\) or \\(n \\geq 9\\).\nStep 6: Now, let's solve the second inequality: \\[ 9 + 6n + n^2 < 16n + 16 \\implies n^2 - 10n - 7 < 0 \\] The roots of the quadratic equation \\(n^2 - 10n - 7 = 0\\) are: \\[ n = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 + 28}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{128}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm 8\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2} \\] Approximating the roots, we get: \\[ n \\approx 5 \\pm 5.66 \\implies n \\approx -0.66 \\text{ or } n \\approx 10.66 \\] So, the solutions to the inequality \\(n^2 - 10n - 7 < 0\\) are: \\[ -0.66 < n < 10.66 \\]\nStep 7: Combining the solutions from both inequalities, we get: \\[ n \\leq 1 \\text{ or } n \\geq 9 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -0.66 < n < 10.66 \\] This gives us the possible integer values for \\(n\\): \\[ n = 0, 1, 9, 10 \\]\nStep 8: Now, we substitute these values back into the equation \\(t = \\frac{3 + n}{4}\\): First, for \\(n = 0\\), \\(t = \\frac{3 + 0}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\\). Second, for \\(n = 1\\), \\(t = \\frac{3 + 1}{4} = 1\\). Third, for \\(n = 9\\), \\(t = \\frac{3 + 9}{4} = 3\\). Fourth, for \\(n = 10\\), \\(t = \\frac{3 + 10}{4} = \\frac{13}{4}\\).\nStep 9: We need to check if these values satisfy the original condition \\(n \\leq t^2 < n+1\\): - For \\(t = \\frac{3}{4}\\), \\(t^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{16} \\approx 0.5625\\), so \\(0 \\leq \\frac{9}{16} < 1\\). This is true. - For \\(t = 1\\), \\(t^2 = 1^2 = 1\\), so \\(1 \\leq 1 < 2\\). This is true. - For \\(t = 3\\), \\(t^2 = 3^2 = 9\\), so \\(9 \\leq 9 < 10\\). This is true. - For \\(t = \\frac{13}{4}\\), \\(t^2 = \\left(\\frac{13}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{169}{16} \\approx 10.5625\\), so \\(10 \\leq \\frac{169}{16} < 11\\). This is true.\nStep 10: Therefore, the possible values of \\(t = \\log x\\) are \\(\\frac{3}{4}, 1, 3, \\frac{13}{4}\\). Converting these back to \\(x\\), we get: \\[ x = 10^{\\frac{3}{4}}, 10^1, 10^3, 10^{\\frac{13}{4}} \\]\nStep 11: The product of these values is: \\[ 10^{\\frac{3}{4}} \\cdot 10^1 \\cdot 10^3 \\cdot 10^{\\frac{13}{4}} = 10^{\\frac{3}{4} + 1 + 3 + \\frac{13}{4}} = 10^{\\frac{3 + 4 + 12 + 13}{4}} = 10^{\\frac{32}{4}} = 10^8 \\]",
        "now_step": "Step 12: Thus, the value of \\(y\\) is: \\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",

First, let's consider the first equation:\n\\[ x\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + y - 2x^2\\right) = 0 \\]\nStep 2: This equation can be rewritten as:\n\\[ x\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + y - 2x^2\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{2} + y - 2x^2 = 0 \\text{ or } x = 0 \\]\nStep 3: From the last part of the equation, we have \\(x = 0\\).

Therefore, we can write the equation: \\[(5)^2 + (5+d)^2 + (5+2d)^2 = (5+3d)^2 + (5+4d)^2.\\]\nStep 2: First, we expand each square: \\[ 25 + (25 + 10d + d^2) + (25 + 20d + 4d^2) = (25 + 30d + 9d^2) + (25 + 40d + 16d^2). \\]\nStep 3: Next, we combine like terms on both sides of the equation: \\[ 25 + 25 + 25 + 10d + 20d + d^2 + 4d^2 = 25 + 25 + 30d + 40d + 9d^2 + 16d^2, \\] \\[ 75 + 30d + 5d^2 = 50 + 70d + 25d^2. \\]\nStep 4: Then, we move all terms to one side of the equation to set it to zero: \\[ 75 + 30d + 5d^2 - 50 - 70d - 25d^2 = 0, \\] \\[ 25 - 40d - 20d^2 = 0. \\]\nStep 5: We can factor out a common factor of -5 from the equation: \\[ -5(4d^2 + 8d - 5) = 0. \\] This gives us: \\[ 4d^2 + 8d - 5 = 0. \\]\nStep 6: We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(d = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 8\\), and \\(c = -5\\): \\[ d = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot (-5)}}{2 \\cdot 4}, \\] \\[ d = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 80}}{8}, \\] \\[ d = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{8}, \\] \\[ d = \\frac{-8 \\pm 12}{8}. \\]\nStep 7: This gives us two possible solutions for \\(d\\): \\[ d = \\frac{-8 + 12}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}, \\] \\[ d = \\frac{-8 - 12}{8} = \\frac{-20}{8} = -\\frac{5}{2}. \\]\nStep 8: The fifth term of the sequence is given by \\(5 + 4d\\).
