Let's verify:\nSubstitute \\( f(n) = 2n + 1007 \\) into the original equation:\n\\[ f(f(m) + n) + f(m) = f(n) + f(3m) + 2014 \\]\n\\[ f(2m + 1007 + n) + 2m + 1007 = 2n + 1007 + 2(3m) + 1007 + 2014 \\]\n\\[ f(2m + n + 1007) + 2m + 1007 = 2n + 1007 + 6m + 1007 + 2014 \\]\n\\[ 2(2m + n + 1007) + 1007 + 2m + 1007 = 2n + 1007 + 6m + 1007 + 2014 \\]\n\\[ 4m + 2n + 2014 + 1007 + 2m + 1007 = 2n + 1007 + 6m + 1007 + 2014 \\]\n\\[ 6m + 2n + 4028 = 6m + 2n + 4028 \\]\nStep 11: Both sides are equal, confirming that \\( f(n) = 2n + 1007 \\) is indeed a solution.",

First, let's list the values of \\( p(n) \\) for the first few positive integers:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} p(1) &= 1, \\\\ p(2) &= 2, \\\\ p(3) &= 3, \\\\ p(4) &= 5, \\\\ p(5) &= 7, \\\\ p(6) &= 11, \\\\ p(7) &= 15, \\\\ p(8) &= 22, \\\\ p(9) &= 30, \\\\ p(10) &= 42. \\end{aligned} \\]\nStep 2: Now, we will check the equation \\( p(n) + p(n+4) = p(n+2) + p(n+3) \\) for these values.\nStep 3: First, for \\( n = 1 \\):\n\\[ p(1) + p(5) = 1 + 7 = 8, \\quad p(3) + p(4) = 3 + 5 = 8. \\]\nSo, the equation holds for \\( n = 1 \\).\nStep 4: Second, for \\( n = 2 \\):\n\\[ p(2) + p(6) = 2 + 11 = 13, \\quad p(4) + p(5) = 5 + 7 = 12. \\]\nSo, the equation does not hold for \\( n = 2 \\).\nStep 5: Third, for \\( n = 3 \\):\n\\[ p(3) + p(7) = 3 + 15 = 18, \\quad p(5) + p(6) = 7 + 11 = 18. \\]\nSo, the equation holds for \\( n = 3 \\).\nStep 6: Fourth, for \\( n = 4 \\):\n\\[ p(4) + p(8) = 5 + 22 = 27, \\quad p(6) + p(7) = 11 + 15 = 26. \\]\nSo, the equation does not hold for \\( n = 4 \\).\nStep 7: Fifth, for \\( n = 5 \\):\n\\[ p(5) + p(9) = 7 + 30 = 37, \\quad p(7) + p(8) = 15 + 22 = 37. \\]\nSo, the equation holds for \\( n = 5 \\).\nStep 8: Sixth, for \\( n = 6 \\):\n\\[ p(6) + p(10) = 11 + 42 = 53, \\quad p(8) + p(9) = 22 + 30 = 52. \\]\nSo, the equation does not hold for \\( n = 6 \\).\nStep 9: From the above calculations, we observe that the equation \\( p(n) + p(n+4) = p(n+2) + p(n+3) \\) holds for \\( n = 1, 3, \\) and \\( 5 \\). To confirm that these are the only solutions, we need to consider the general behavior of the partition function. The partition function \\( p(n) \\) grows rapidly, and the differences between consecutive values become larger as \\( n \\) increases. Therefore, it is unlikely that the equation will hold for larger values of \\( n \\).",

We know that $64 = 2^6$, but we can rewrite it as a power of 3 since $64 = (4)^3 = (2^2)^3 = (2^3)^2 = 8^2 = (2^3)^2 * (2)^0 = 8^2 * 1 = (2^3)^2 * (2^0) = (2^3)^2 * (1) = (2^3)^2 * 1 = (2^3)^2 * 1^1 = (8)^2 * 1^1 = (2^3)^2 * (1^1) = (2^3)^2 * (1^1) = (2^3)^2 * (1^1) = (8)^2 * (1^1) = 64$. However, 64 is also equal to $(4)^3$, which simplifies to $(2^2)^3 = (2^3)^2$. Therefore, 64 is $(2^3)^2$ or $8^2$. Since $8^2$ is also $64$, then we can write $64$ as $8^2$, which can be expressed as $(2^3)^2$, which is equivalent to $((2)^3)^2$ or $(2^3)^2$. Using exponent laws, we can simplify $(2^3)^2$ as $2^(3*2)$, which simplifies to $2^6$. However, we can express 64 as a power of 3 by rewriting it as $(3^2)^3$. This is because we are using exponent laws to simplify $(2^3)^2$ as $2^6$. We can use the same approach to rewrite 64 as a power of 3 by rewriting it as $(3^2)^3$, which equals $3^(2*3)$ or $3^6$.",

Therefore, at least one pair among \\(a, b, c,\\) and \\(d\\) must be the same.\nStep 3: Extending to Larger Grids: To maximize the number of colors, we need to ensure that the constraint is satisfied while using as many different colors as possible. We will explore a coloring pattern that can achieve this.\nStep 4: Checkerboard Pattern: One effective way to ensure the constraint is met is to use a checkerboard pattern. In a checkerboard pattern, adjacent unit squares are different colors, but every \\(2 \\times 2\\) sub-square contains exactly two squares of each color:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \\hline A & B & A & B \\\\ \\hline B & A & B & A \\\\ \\hline A & B & A & B \\\\ \\hline B & A & B & A \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\]\nIn this pattern, each \\(2 \\times 2\\) sub-square has exactly two \\(A\\)s and two \\(B\\)s, satisfying the constraint.\nStep 5: Generalizing to \\(n \\times n\\) Grid: For an \\(n \\times n\\) grid, we can apply the same checkerboard pattern.

First, let's recall Euler's criterion, which states that for any integer \\( a \\) not divisible by \\( p \\):\n\\[ a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv \\left( \\frac{a}{p} \\right) \\pmod{p} \\]\nStep 2: where \\( \\left( \\frac{a}{p} \\right) \\) is the Legendre symbol, defined as:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{a}{p} \\right) = 1 \\text{ if } a \\text{ is a quadratic residue modulo } p \\]\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{a}{p} \\right) = -1 \\text{ if } a \\text{ is a quadratic non-residue modulo } p \\]\nStep 3: Now, consider the set \\( A \\), which contains all integers \\( a \\) such that \\( 1 \\le a < p \\), and both \\( a \\) and \\( 4 - a \\) are quadratic non-residues. We can rewrite this condition using the Legendre symbol:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{a}{p} \\right) = -1 \\text{ and } \\left( \\frac{4-a}{p} \\right) = -1 \\]\nStep 4: Using Euler's criterion, we can rewrite these conditions as:\n\\[ a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\]\n\\[ (4-a)^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\]\nStep 5: Now, let's consider the product of the elements of \\( A \\), which we'll denote as \\( P \\). We can write:\n\\[ P = \\prod_{a \\in A} a \\]\nStep 6: We want to find the remainder of \\( P \\) when divided by \\( p \\). To do this, we'll use the fact that the product of the Legendre symbols is multiplicative:\n\\[ \\prod_{a \\in A} \\left( \\frac{a}{p} \\right) = \\prod_{a \\in A} (-1) = (-1)^{|A|} \\]\nStep 7: where \\( |A| \\) is the number of elements in \\( A \\). Using Euler's criterion again, we can rewrite this as:\n\\[ \\prod_{a \\in A} a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv (-1)^{|A|} \\pmod{p} \\]\nStep 8: Now, let's consider the product of the elements of \\( A \\), but with each element raised to the power \\( (p-1)/2 \\):\n\\[ \\prod_{a \\in A} a^{(p-1)/2} = \\left( \\prod_{a \\in A} a \\right)^{(p-1)/2} = P^{(p-1)/2} \\]\nStep 9: So, we have:\n\\[ P^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv (-1)^{|A|} \\pmod{p} \\]\nStep 10: Since \\( p \\) is an odd prime, \\( (p-1)/2 \\) is an integer. Therefore, we can raise both sides to the power 2 to get:\n\\[ P^{p-1} \\equiv ((-1)^{|A|})^2 \\pmod{p} \\]\nStep 11: Using Fermat's little theorem, which states that \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) for any integer \\( a \\) not divisible by \\( p \\), we can simplify this to:\n\\[ P^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\]\nStep 12: Therefore, we have:\n\\[ 1 \\equiv ((-1)^{|A|})^2 \\pmod{p} \\]\nStep 13: This implies that:\n\\[ (-1)^{|A|} = \\pm 1 \\]",
        "now_step": "Step 14: Since \\( |A| \\) is an integer, we know that \\( |A| \\) is either even or odd. If \\( |A| \\) is even, then \\( (-1)^{|A|} = 1 \\). If \\( |A| \\) is odd, then \\( (-1)^{|A|} = -1 \\). However, we also know that the product of the elements of \\( A \\) is congruent to \\( (-1)^{|A|} \\) modulo \\( p \\). Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\\[ P \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{p} \\]",

Solving for \\(a\\): \\[ 2 \\leq a \\leq \\sqrt{2021} \\approx 44.95 \\] Thus, \\(a\\) can take integer values from 2 to 44, inclusive.

However, since the sequence is increasing and the limit condition holds, we can always find a larger $n$ where the same inequality holds due to the nature of how quickly $a_n$ grows (or doesn't grow) relative to $n$.",

The medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid, which divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. The centroid of the triangle is the origin \\((0,0)\\) because all the medians pass through the origin. Let the vertices of the triangle be \\(A = (x_1, y_1)\\), \\(B = (x_2, y_2)\\), and \\(C = (x_3, y_3)\\). Since the centroid is the origin, we have:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3} \\right) = (0,0) \\]\nStep 2: This implies:\n\\[ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = 0 \\]\nStep 3: The median from vertex \\(A\\) to the midpoint of \\(BC\\) is \\(y = x\\).

Using the centroid condition \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0\\) and \\(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = 0\\), we get:\n\\[ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 0 \\]\nStep 10: Solving these equations, we can express \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\) in terms of \\(x_1\\):\n\\[ x_2 = -2x_1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_3 = x_1 \\]\nStep 11: Thus, the coordinates of the vertices are \\(A = (x_1, x_1)\\), \\(B = (-2x_1, -4x_1)\\), and \\(C = (x_1, 3x_1)\\).\nStep 12: Next, we calculate the lengths of the sides of the triangle:\n\\[ AB = \\sqrt{(x_1 - (-2x_1))^2 + (x_1 - (-4x_1))^2} = \\sqrt{(3x_1)^2 + (5x_1)^2} = \\sqrt{34} |x_1| \\]\n\\[ BC = \\sqrt{((-2x_1) - x_1)^2 + ((-4x_1) - 3x_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(-3x_1)^2 + (-7x_1)^2} = \\sqrt{58} |x_1| \\]\n\\[ CA = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_1)^2 + (3x_1 - x_1)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + (2x_1)^2} = 2 |x_1| \\]\nStep 13: The perimeter of the triangle is:\n\\[ AB + BC + CA = \\sqrt{34} |x_1| + \\sqrt{58} |x_1| + 2 |x_1| = (\\sqrt{34} + \\sqrt{58} + 2) |x_1| = 1 \\]\nStep 14: Thus,\n\\[ |x_1| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34} + \\sqrt{58} + 2} \\]",

Carl starts running, and then Andr\u00e9 starts running 20 s later. After Andr\u00e9 has been running for 10 s, he catches up to Carl. What is the ratio $y: x$?",
        "previous_steps": "Step 1: To find the ratio $y : x$, we can start by analyzing the situation. First, Carl runs at a constant speed of $x \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Second, Andr\u00e9 runs at a constant speed of $y \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Third, Carl starts running, and then Andr\u00e9 starts running 20 s later. Fourth, after Andr\u00e9 has been running for 10 s, he catches up to Carl.\nStep 2: Let's break down the information: Since Andr\u00e9 starts 20 s after Carl, Carl will have run for 20 s when Andr\u00e9 starts. When Andr\u00e9 starts, the distance between them is the distance Carl covered in 20 s, which is $20x$ meters. Andr\u00e9 runs for 10 s, covering a distance of $10y$ meters. By the time Andr\u00e9 catches up to Carl, the total distance covered by both of them must be equal.\nStep 3: Since Andr\u00e9 catches up to Carl after running for 10 s, we know that Carl also covers the same distance in the same time, but starting 20 s earlier.

So, the total distance covered by Andr\u00e9 is $10y$ meters. Since they catch up at the end, we set up the equation: $d + 20x = 10y$.\nStep 4: Now, let's think about how much distance Carl covers in those 10 s. We can use the fact that Carl runs at a constant speed of $x \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. In 10 s, Carl covers a distance of $10x$ meters. Therefore, the distance $d$ is equal to $10x$.

The ratio $y : x$ is therefore $3 : 1$. So, the answer is $\\boxed{3:1}$ or simply $\\boxed{3}$ if you are looking for a single number.",

First, if \\(a = 1\\), then \\(c \\geq \\sqrt[2]{2 \\cdot 1^3} = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\). Since \\(c\\) is a positive integer, \\(c \\geq 2\\).

Substituting \\(a = 1\\) and \\(c = 3\\) into the equation, we get: \\[ 2 \\cdot 1^3 + 3^3 = 1^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\implies 2 + 27 = 9 \\implies 29 = 9, \\] which is false. Therefore, there are no solutions for \\(a = 1\\).\nStep 4: Second, if \\(a = 2\\), then \\(c \\geq \\sqrt[2]{2 \\cdot 2^3} = \\sqrt[2]{16} = 4\\). Since \\(c\\) is a positive integer, \\(c \\geq 4\\). Substituting \\(a = 2\\) and \\(c = 4\\) into the equation, we get: \\[ 2 \\cdot 2^3 + 4^3 = 2^4 \\cdot 4^2 \\implies 2 \\cdot 8 + 64 = 16 \\cdot 16 \\implies 16 + 64 = 256 \\implies 80 = 256, \\] which is false. Substituting \\(a = 2\\) and \\(c = 5\\) into the equation, we get: \\[ 2 \\cdot 2^3 + 5^3 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\implies 2 \\cdot 8 + 125 = 16 \\cdot 25 \\implies 16 + 125 = 400 \\implies 141 = 400, \\] which is false. Therefore, there are no solutions for \\(a = 2\\).\nStep 5: Third, if \\(a = 3\\), then \\(c \\geq \\sqrt[2]{2 \\cdot 3^3} = \\sqrt[2]{54} \\approx 7.35\\). Since \\(c\\) is a positive integer, \\(c \\geq 8\\). Substituting \\(a = 3\\) and \\(c = 9\\) into the equation, we get: \\[ 2 \\cdot 3^3 + 9^3 = 3^4 \\cdot 9^2 \\implies 2 \\cdot 27 + 729 = 81 \\cdot 81 \\implies 54 + 729 = 6561 \\implies 783 = 6561, \\] which is false. Therefore, there are no solutions for \\(a = 3\\).",

Solving for \\( r \\), we have \\(2r = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\), which simplifies to \\(2r = \\frac{1}{2}\\), and thus \\(r = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\nStep 4: Now that we have the values of \\( q \\) and \\( r \\), let's substitute them into one of the original equations to find the value of \\( p \\). We'll use equation (3): \\(p + q + r = 2\\). Substituting the values, we get \\(p + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 2\\).

The probability of this scenario happening plus the game resetting is \\( \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^3 \\).\nStep 5: Generalizing the pattern:\n- For Jill to draw the spade on her \\( n \\)-th turn, the sequence must be:\n- Jack does not draw a spade \\( n-1 \\) times.\n- Jill does not draw a spade \\( n-1 \\) times.\n- John does not draw a spade \\( n-1 \\) times.\n- Jack does not draw a spade on the \\( n \\)-th cycle.\n- Jill draws a spade on the \\( n \\)-th cycle.\n- The combined probability for this sequence is: \\[ \\left( \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^3 \\right)^{n-1} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n- Simplifying, we get: \\[ \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^{3(n-1)} \\times \\frac{3}{16} \\]\nStep 6: Summing the probabilities:\n- The total probability that Jill draws the spade is the sum of the probabilities of all these scenarios: \\[ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^{3(n-1)} \\times \\frac{3}{16} \\]\n- This is an infinite geometric series with the first term \\( a = \\frac{3}{16} \\) and common ratio \\( r = \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^3 = \\frac{27}{64} \\): \\[ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{27}{64} \\right)^n \\times \\frac{3}{16} \\]\n- The sum of an infinite geometric series \\( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} ar^n \\) is given by \\( \\frac{a}{1-r} \\): \\[ \\frac{\\frac{3}{16}}{1 - \\frac{27}{64}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{16}}{\\frac{37}{64}} = \\frac{3}{16} \\times \\frac{64}{37} = \\frac{12}{37} \\]",
        "now_step": "Step 7: Therefore, the probability that Jill draws the spade is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{12}{37}}\\).",
