Using the fact that $|a+b|^2=(a+b)(\\overline{a}+\\overline{b})$, we have: $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2 = (z+\\frac{1}{z})(\\overline{z}+\\frac{1}{\\overline{z}})$.</paragraph_3>\n\n<paragraph_4>Expanding the right-hand side, we get: $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2 = |z|^2 + \\frac{1}{|z|^2} + z\\overline{z} + \\frac{1}{z\\overline{z}}$. Since $z\\overline{z}=|z|^2$ and $\\frac{1}{z\\overline{z}}=\\frac{1}{|z|^2}$, we have: $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2 = 2 + \\frac{1}{|z|^2} + \\frac{1}{|z|^2}$. Simplifying, we get: $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2 = 2 + \\frac{2}{|z|^2}$.</paragraph_4>\n\n<paragraph_5>To find the minimum value of $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2$, we need to find the maximum value of $\\frac{1}{|z|^2}$. From the equation $\\frac{1225}{1369}|z|^4=(-\\text{Im}(z)^2 + 2\\text{Re}(z)\\text{Im}(z))^2$, we can see that $\\frac{1}{|z|^2}$ must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{1225}{1369}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2$ is $2 + \\frac{2(1225/1369)}{1} = 2 + \\frac{2450}{1369} = \\frac{2789}{1369}$.</paragraph_5>\n\n<paragraph_6>To find the minimum value of $d^2$, we multiply the minimum value of $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2$ by itself: $d^2 = (\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|)^2 = \\frac{2789}{1369}$. However, since $d$ is the absolute value of $z+\\frac{1}{z}$, we can simply take the square root of the result: $d^2 = \\frac{2789}{1369}$.</paragraph_6>"

This implies that the sums of their digits are not divisible by 9.</paragraph_0>\n\n<paragraph_1>The sum of the digits of \\(M\\) is \\(4 + A + 6 = A + 10\\). Since this sum is not divisible by 9, \\(A + 10\\) must leave a remainder of either 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8 when divided by 9. Similarly, the sum of the digits of \\(N\\) is \\(1 + B + 7 = B + 8\\). Since this sum is not divisible by 9, \\(B + 8\\) must leave a remainder of either 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8 when divided by 9.</paragraph_1>\n\n<paragraph_2>Now, let's consider the product \\(M \\cdot N\\). We are given that this product is divisible by 9. For this to happen, the sum of the products of the corresponding digits must be divisible by 9. Since the product of 4 and 1 is 4, the product of 6 and 7 is 42, and the product of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) will be \\(A \\times B\\), the sum of the products of the corresponding digits is:\n\\[ 4 + (A \\times B) + 42 = (A \\times B) + 46 \\]\nFor this sum to be divisible by 9, \\((A \\times B) + 46\\) must leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 9. Since \\(46 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}\\), \\((A \\times B)\\) must leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 9.</paragraph_2>\n\n<paragraph_3>Considering all the possible combinations of remainders, we can try different values for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that \\(A + 10\\) and \\(B + 8\\) leave certain remainders when divided by 9, and \\((A \\times B)\\) leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 9.</paragraph_3>\n\n<paragraph_4>First, if \\(A + 10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}\\), then \\(A \\equiv -9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}\\), which is impossible since \\(A\\) is a digit.</paragraph_4>\n\n<paragraph_5>Second, if \\(A + 10 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{9}\\), then \\(A \\equiv -8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}\\). In this case, \\(B + 8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}\\), so \\((A \\times B)\\) cannot leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 9.</paragraph_5>\n\n<paragraph_6>Third, if \\(A + 10 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{9}\\), then \\(A \\equiv -6 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}\\). In this case, \\(B + 8 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}\\), so \\((A \\times B)\\) cannot leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 9.</paragraph_6>\n\n<paragraph_7>Fourth, if \\(A + 10 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}\\), then \\(A \\equiv -4 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}\\). In this case, \\(B + 8 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}\\), so \\((A \\times B)\\) cannot leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 9.</paragraph_7>\n\n<paragraph_8>Fifth, if \\(A + 10 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}\\), then \\(A \\equiv -3 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}\\). In this case, \\(B + 8 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}\\), so \\((A \\times B)\\) cannot leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 9.</paragraph_8>\n\n<paragraph_9>Sixth, if \\(A + 10 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}\\), then \\(A \\equiv -2 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}\\). In this case, \\(B + 8 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{9}\\), so \\((A \\times B)\\) cannot leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 9.</paragraph_9>\n\n<paragraph_10>However, if \\(A + 10 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{9}\\) and \\(B + 8 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}\\), then \\((A \\times B)\\) could leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 9. This implies that \\(A = 5\\) (since 5 + 10 = 15, and 15 is congruent to 6 mod 9, but 6 - 1 = 5 is congruent to 4 mod 9), and \\(B = 6\\) (since 6 + 8 = 14, and 14 is congruent to 5 mod 9).</paragraph_10>\n\n<paragraph_11>Therefore, the largest possible value of \\(A + B\\) is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).</paragraph_11>"

There are infinitely many pairs of coprime integers, but since we are only counting distinct polynomials, we only consider positive values (since negative values would result in the same polynomial when squared).

However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$.

Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.",

However, our main goal is to directly compute \\(f(\\pi)\\), which requires simplifying or understanding how \\(f\\) acts on \\(\\frac{\\pi + 4}{2}\\) without getting into an overly complicated algebraic manipulation beyond what's necessary.</paragraph_7>\n\n<paragraph_8>To simplify further, let's clarify the direct approach to finding \\(f(\\pi)\\) based on the information provided. Given the complexity of directly solving for \\(f(\\pi)\\) from the derived expression without knowing the explicit form of \\(f(x)\\), let's reconsider our approach towards finding \\(f(\\pi)\\) more directly based on the initial conditions and transformations.</paragraph_8>\n\n<paragraph_9>**Correct Approach:**\n1. Understanding \\(g^{-1}(x)\\): \\(g^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x + 4}{2}\\)\n2. Substitute \\(g^{-1}(x)\\) into \\(f\\): The key here is recognizing how \\(f\\) interacts with \\(g^{-1}\\) through the equation \\(g(f(g^{-1}(x)))\\).</paragraph_9>\n\n<paragraph_10>The confusion arose from attempting to directly manipulate the equation \\(f\\left(\\frac{x + 4}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2x^2 + 16x + 26}{x}\\) to find \\(f(\\pi)\\) without properly applying the inverse function and transformation steps.</paragraph_10>\n\n<paragraph_11>**Correcting the approach:**\nGiven \\(g(x) = 2x - 4\\) and \\(g^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x + 4}{2}\\), the equation \\(g(f(g^{-1}(x))) = 2x^2 + 16x + 26\\) suggests how \\(f\\) operates in relation to \\(g\\). However, to directly find \\(f(\\pi)\\), it's crucial to understand that the provided equation essentially defines \\(f\\) in terms of \\(g\\) and its inverse, but the direct calculation of \\(f(\\pi)\\) without additional information about \\(f\\) itself might not be straightforward from the given equation alone.</paragraph_11>\n\n<paragraph_12>A more insightful approach involves recognizing the transformation between variables rather than directly solving for \\(f(\\pi)\\) in the given equation structure. However, since the goal was to illustrate the process of working through such a problem and the direct calculation did not yield a clear path to \\(f(\\pi)\\) without additional assumptions or clarification, let's correct the oversight and clarify.</paragraph_12>\n\n<paragraph_13>**Clarification:**\nGiven the nature of the problem and the equations provided, the direct calculation of \\(f(\\pi)\\) from \\(g(f(g^{-1}(x))) = 2x^2 + 16x + 26\\) requires understanding how \\(f\\) operates on inputs that pass through \\(g\\) and its inverse. However, without additional specifics on \\(f\\) or a simplified way to express \\(f\\) based on the given information, reaching a definitive solution for \\(f(\\pi)\\) directly from the given equation is challenging.</paragraph_13>\n\n<paragraph_14>**Conclusion:**\nGiven the steps outlined, it became apparent that a direct calculation for \\(f(\\pi)\\) from the provided equation without further specification or simplification of \\(f\\) is complex and may lead to misunderstanding. The essence of the problem involves understanding the relationships between functions \\(g\\), \\(f\\), and their inverses, as well as how these functions transform inputs. For clarity and precision, it's important to revisit the problem statement and ensure all given conditions are correctly applied and understood. In this case, the process of reasoning through the relationships and transformations was detailed, but a definitive numerical answer for \\(f(\\pi)\\) was not attainable without additional information or a clearer path within the constraints of the provided problem setup.</paragraph_14>"

Therefore, we have two possible values for $x$: $x_1 = \\frac{3 + 1}{4} = 1$ and $x_2 = \\frac{3 - 1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.</paragraph_4>\n\n<paragraph_5>Recalling that $x = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}} \\sin \\theta$, we substitute these values back in: $\\log_{\\frac{1}{2}} \\sin \\theta = 1$ and $\\log_{\\frac{1}{2}} \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$. From the definition of logarithms, we know that if $\\log_b x = y$, then $b^y = x$. Applying this to our equations, we get: $\\frac{1}{2}^1 = \\sin \\theta$ and $\\frac{1}{2}^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sin \\theta$.</paragraph_5>\n\n<paragraph_6>Simplifying these expressions, we get: $\\frac{1}{2} = \\sin \\theta$ and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sin \\theta$. Now we need to find the values of $\\theta$ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$ that satisfy these equations.</paragraph_6>\n\n<paragraph_7>For $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have: $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ and $\\theta = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$. For $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, we have: $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{4}$.</paragraph_7>\n\n<paragraph_8>Therefore, the values of $\\theta$ for which $f(g(\\sin \\theta)) = 0$ are: $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4}, \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.</paragraph_8>"

        "problem": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nFind the $E(2020,1993)$",

This imposes a strong condition on the function \\(f\\), implying that as \\(x\\) increases, the combined value of \\(f(y)\\) and \\(f(y + f(x) - 1)\\) must grow at least linearly with \\(x\\).</paragraph_3>\n\n<paragraph_4>Third, consider Inequality 3: \\(x + f(y + f(x) - 1) > f(y)\\). Similar to Inequality 1, this inequality doesn't directly restrict \\(f\\) but implies that the sum of \\(x\\) and \\(f(y + f(x) - 1)\\) must exceed \\(f(y)\\). This further supports the notion that \\(f\\) must grow in a manner that ensures such conditions are met.</paragraph_4>\n\n<paragraph_5>Considering the implications of these inequalities, we realize that for a function \\(f\\) satisfying the given condition, it must grow at least linearly with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). A more direct approach to ensure the formation of triangles for all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is to consider the simplest form that satisfies the conditions. The most straightforward function that meets these criteria is one where \\(f\\) grows linearly or faster with its argument. A simple candidate to test is \\(f(n) = n\\).</paragraph_5>\n\n<paragraph_6>This function clearly satisfies the given condition because for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we have:\n- \\(x + f(y) = x + y > f(y + f(x) - 1) = f(y + x - 1)\\) if \\(x \\geq y\\), and \\(y + x - 1\\) is indeed an integer.\n- Similarly, \\(f(y) + f(y + f(x) - 1) = y + (y + x - 1) = 2y + x - 1 > x\\).\n- And \\(x + f(y + f(x) - 1) = x + (y + x - 1) = 2x + y - 1 > y\\).</paragraph_6>\n\n<paragraph_7>Therefore, \\(f(n) = n\\) is a valid solution. Given the nature of the constraints and the necessity of forming a triangle for all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), it's plausible that this linear function might be the only solution or that other solutions might not satisfy the requirements for all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).</paragraph_7>\n\n<paragraph_8>Hence, the solution is \\(f(n) = n\\) for all positive integers \\(n\\). This function trivially satisfies the requirement for forming a triangle for all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) due to its linear growth rate.</paragraph_8>"

Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef.
